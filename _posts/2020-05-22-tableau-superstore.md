# Description 
This is the first project that I've done outside of Makeover Mondays. 
The reason for that was that I wanted to try making a visualization related to the performance indicators of businesses. 
I decided to use the default dataset provided by Tableau because clean and detailed real-life business performance dataset are not easy to come by. 

The focus for the project was to divide up the information into various sections (i.e. Sales, Manufacturers, Consumers) and show charts indicating performance. 

- Although the state of Arizona posted a negative profit percentage, it should be noted that the sales have almost doubled from 2018 to 2019. 
  - Given the increasing sales in nearby regions, there are reasons to be optimistic about future sales in Arizona.
- On the other hand, the state of Virginia appears to be profitable but saw their sales drop by nearly 3 times from 2018 to 2019. 
  - This is especially concerning since the business is seeing a very positive trend in sales in nearby regions.

Key Features & Techniques Required for Project: 
  - Filled Interactive World Map
  - Bubble Plot 
  - Interactive Pie Chart
  - Creating actions on dashboard to filter information on different variables from different plots
  - Use of tabs to publish multiple dashboards
