Recently, I started learning Tableau and am getting familiarized with it. 
As of now, I am working on challenges from a weekly challenge called [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/). 
It gives a sample visualization with a dataset and challenges people to make a "better" visualization. 

Please do note that I am currently focusing most of my efforts into the technical aspects of Tableau, not the design aspect. It will certainly look presentable but my goal isn't to make the prettiest visualization as of now - just getting more experience in making different types of plots and charts.
