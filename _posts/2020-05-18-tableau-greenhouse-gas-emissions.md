# Description 
This project was done as part of the [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) challenge. 
The project focused on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions created in the food cycle - starting prior to even farms. I felt that there was very little room of creativity on this project as the goal of the visualization was quite well-defined - to show the greenhouse gas emissions at each stage of the food cycle. 
As such, I decide to create two charts showing greenhouse gas emissions in different ways. 
The first was a stacked bar chart which was able to show the total greenhouse gas emission for each food product - and how much a certain stage contributes to the total amount. 
The second was a heat chart displaying the stages of high greenhouse gas emission per types of food. This involved grouping foods into different categories and showing the relationship between food groups and food cycle stages. 

Key Features & Techniques Required for Project: 
  - Heat Maps
  - Stacked Bar Chart
  - Dashboard Design
  - Groupings
  - Editing Axis
